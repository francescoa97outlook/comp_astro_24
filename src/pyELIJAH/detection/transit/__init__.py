    Transit detection module. Here are presents two modules:
        - transit.py, that produce the transit light curve
          using the batman-package and the quadratic
          limb-darkening parametrization.
        - transit_yaml.py, a more complete version of
          transit.py that still calculates the light
          curve, but in a more personalized way
